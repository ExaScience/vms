Each sub-folder contains a Makefile:

native: compile with standard $CXX compiler, and run natively. Tested with
        Clang.

smp-x86: Compile with OmpSS@smp mcxx, run natively. Tested with OmpSS 17.12.1.

smp-arm64: compile with mcxx-arm64/1.4.2 that comes with autoVivado 1.4.2.
        Run with QEMU (qemu-aarch64).

fpga-zcu102: Generates bitstream, and BOOT.BIN file for ZCU102 with autoVivado.
        make bitstream
        make boot
        run.sh
        

In the top dir:

run.tcl: Compile with Vivado_HLS and run RTL/C co-simulation. Tested with
