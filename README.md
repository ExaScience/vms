# Virtual Molecule Screening benchmark

Virtual Molecule Screening (VMS) is a computational technique used in drug
discovery that uses machine learning to predict if a chemical compound is likely to bind to a drug target.

This repo contains several implementations of VMS generated from a Matrix Factorization model built by [SMURFF](https://github.com/ExaScience/smurff)
